### Useful resources

[Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)
for his excellent YouTube tutorials, i can not describe how much he has helped me with learning web development.

[Modern CSS](moderncss.dev)
Has a lot of useful resources there, i've learned how to always position the footer to the bottom of the screen thanks to it.

[Solo Learn](sololearn.com)
Helped me get started with web development. Good for anyone starting out web development.

[Piccalil](https://piccalil.li)
For the amazing CSS Reset that i've used in this project.
The site has a ton more useful resources that i've yet to learn.

[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
Started a course there on Responsive Web Development recently and learned a few things, i will be visiting this site quite a bit going forward, as it has everything i want to learn about web development.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
For the designs and guidelines, an amazing resource that lets you focus on the development aspect, instead of trying to both learn designing and web development at the same time.
